Welcome! Chromeintosh is an organization formed by a couple of experienced Hackintosh enthusiasts in the chrultrabook community. Chromeintosh specializes in the conversion of supported Chromebook devices into fully-fledged laptops running the latest editions of Apple’s macOS.

Other than a few drawbacks, almost all features in Chromebooks are supported. Several members in the organization daily drive these “Chromeintoshed” devices, or even use them for work. They are extremely stable once properly configured and set up. Battery life is great on almost all modern devices. 

Before we begin, it is crucial to understand that this project is advanced. Be prepared to tinker, and explore in places you might have never been in before. It takes time. Many of us spend upwards of two or three weeks configuring our devices before they are good enough to use. You will need basic technical knowledge to accomplish the conversion process. Previous Hackintosh experience is required. This project is not for everybody
